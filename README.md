# Coffee Machine System with User & Admin Features

## Overview
This project is a Python-based Coffee Machine system that allows users to order drinks, make payments, track loyalty points, and manage resources. It also includes an admin panel for refilling resources and viewing sales logs. The system uses the `tkinter` library for GUI and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

- **Loyalty Points**: Users earn loyalty points for every purchase, which can be redeemed for discounts.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can refill resources like water, milk, and coffee.
- **Sales Log**: View a detailed log of all transactions.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track remaining resources and view charts depicting resource depletion and sales performance.
